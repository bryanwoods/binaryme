Feature: Responses
  As a user
  I want to respond to questions
  And I want to have my responses saved
  And I want my answers to correspond to the correct questions
  So that I can see my binary number
  
 #Scenario: Answer some questions
    #Given I have already created a profile for "mcmaloney"
    #And I log in
    #And there is an active question "I drink beer"
   #When I follow "Provide Responses"
    #And I answer with "true"
    #Then I should have 1 answer
    #And the answer to the question "I drink beer" should be true
    #And my number should be "1"
